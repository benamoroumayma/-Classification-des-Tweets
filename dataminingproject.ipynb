    "* Il est class√© au 6e rang des sites et applications de r√©seautage social les plus populaires par Dream Grow en avril 2020 avec une moyenne de 330 millions d'utilisateurs mensuels actifs.Contrairement √† d'autres plateformes comme Facebook dont le r√¥le principal est de ¬´rattraper¬ª les amis, c'est l√† que les gens se l√¢chent et interagissent avec diff√©rentes personnalit√©s de tous horizons sur toutes sortes de questions. Cette atmosph√®re est ce qui en fait la plate-forme id√©ale pour les sp√©cialistes du marketing, les politiciens et autres titres dont le succ√®s d√©pend d'une compr√©hension approfondie des opinions des gens.\n",
    "* Gr√¢ce √† l'analyse des sentiments, les parties int√©ress√©es peuvent comprendre de quoi parlent les utilisateurs et, √† partir des informations, prendre les d√©cisions appropri√©es. Cet article se concentre sur la classification des tweets en 4 grandes cat√©gories: √©conomique, social, culturel et de la sant√©, puis sur la r√©alisation d'une analyse de cluster KMeans sur les groupes."

Plus pr√©cis√©ment, si l'on trace le pourcentage de variance expliqu√© par les clusters par rapport au nombre de clusters, les premiers clusters ajouteront beaucoup d'informations (expliquent beaucoup de variance), mais √† un moment donn√© le gain marginal diminuera, donnant un angle dans le graphique.
